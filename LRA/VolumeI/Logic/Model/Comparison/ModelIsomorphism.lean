Model isomorphisms.

A model isomorphism of `M₁` and `M₂` (two models of the same signature `S`)
is a `ModelEmbedding` whose underlying domain map is also surjective --
equivalently, a bijective structure-preserving map. This is the standard
"isomorphism = bijective homomorphism" characterization.

`ModelIsomorphism` extends `ModelEmbedding` rather than being defined from
scratch, because an isomorphism genuinely *is* an embedding plus one more
condition (surjectivity), not a differently-shaped notion -- every theorem
about `ModelEmbedding` (injectivity, atomic preservation) applies to a
`ModelIsomorphism` for free via the `extends` coercion.

A more symmetric, category-theoretic characterization also exists: an
isomorphism as a *pair* of structure-preserving maps `f : M₁ → M₂`,
`g : M₂ → M₁` with `g ∘ f = id` and `f ∘ g = id`, neither direction
privileged. `ModelIsomorphism` does not build this in as the definition,
but `ModelIsomorphism.inverseEmbedding` proves it as a consequence: every
`ModelIsomorphism M₁ M₂` yields a genuine `ModelEmbedding M₂ M₁` in the
reverse direction, constructed from the forward map's bijectivity. Isomorphism
being symmetric is therefore a theorem here, not an assumption.
